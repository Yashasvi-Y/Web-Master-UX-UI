# Web-Master-UX-UI

UI/UX Designer Assignment for WebTeam Recruitment

Task 1: Redesign the Gallery Page
Following changes are made on the gallery page:
1) For events that are organized every year, namely, Orientation, Convocation and Fests, a separate section is made to make it easier for the user to find related data.
2) This section as well as the gallery main page will also be further divided as per the year of occurrence.
3) 2 separate designs are made, one set (Slides 1,1A,1B) have a wave-like design under the sections to catch attention and clearly show the particular sections. The color are used to match the theme of main website to keep consistency in design. Another set (Slides 2,2A,2B) is kept simpler with heavy boundary of section to keep the page neat. This page also have images curved at the vertices to make user clearly detect separation among multiple images.

Additionally, on the navbar for the gallery page, in desktop mode, Name of the institute is added alongside the logo to keep consistency in navbar, as the same page has it on smaller screens. Along with this a few logos have been updated to their recent and widely recognized versions.

Task 2: Create a Placement Stats Poster  3 Placement Posters are designed.
Poster-1 carries a black and white image background with white Text and vibrant Orange color, from website theme, to catch user attention towards the statistics.

Poster-2, contrary to Poster-1, have a colorful background image having blurred codes in it. It also have white text and orange colored statistics.

Poster-3 Have a similar theme as Poster-1 with a slightly different image background.
Poster 1 and 3 have more goal oriented, that is to show statistics of placement of respective year while Poster-2 have a colorful theme to lighten up the feel.
